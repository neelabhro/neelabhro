#### I'm a Master's student pursuing a degree in Information & Network Engineering at the School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en). I'm currently writing my thesis at Ericsson Research, Kista, Sweden focussing on resource allocation and scheduling for XR applications. Prior to this, I was working on the [Experimental Platform for Edge Computing Applications (ExPECA)](https://www.jamesgross.org/research/expeca/) with [Prof. James Gross](https://www.kth.se/profile/jamesgr) as a Research Assistant at KTH and also exploring the applications of Semantically Optimized Deep Learning solutions for wireless communications. I spent my summers last year with [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref) where my research was focused on Cognitive Architectures for Management and Orchestration @ End-to-End Networks and Service Automation Lab, based out of Espoo, Finland.
