### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm a Master's student pursuing a degree in Information & Network Engineering at the School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I'm currently working on the Experimental Platform for Edge Computing Applications (ExPECA) under Prof. James Gross as a Research Assistant. I'm spending my summers these days with Nokia Bell Labs, advised by Dr. Vilho RÃ¤isÃ¤nen and Dr. Mohammed Elbamby. Here at Bell Labs my research is focused on Cognitive Architectures for Management and Orchestration @ End-to-End Networks and Service Automation Lab, based out of Espoo, Finland
