### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm a Master's student pursuing a degree in Information & Network Engineering at the School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en). I'm currently working on the [Experimental Platform for Edge Computing Applications (ExPECA)](https://www.jamesgross.org/research/expeca/) under [Prof. James Gross](https://www.kth.se/profile/jamesgr) as a Research Assistant. I'm spending my summers these days with [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref), advised by [Dr. Vilho RÃ¤isÃ¤nen](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/vilhoraisanen/#gref) and [Dr. Mohammed Elbamby](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/mohammedelbamby/#gref). Here at Bell Labs my research is focused on Cognitive Architectures for Management and Orchestration @ End-to-End Networks and Service Automation Lab, based out of Espoo, Finland
